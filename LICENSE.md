## 1 Introduction

This license describes the terms and conditions under which you may use, copy, modify, redistribute the resources hereby published. It also describes how you may make and distribute products based on those project files. It is intended to offer a legal standard by which the authors of these files publish their works, stating their intended use.

### 1.1 Definitions

### 1.2 Guide and intended use

This license was written to describe how anyone can make use of the files and resources included in the Acheron Project. The basic idea is that all resources can be used, copied, distributed and modified free of charge, commercially or not, under certain basic conditions. These will be explained in the below clauses to summarize their intent, and will be thoroughly explained through the license.

**(I)** By using, copying, modifying or distributing the resources hereby licensed, including making products and commercializing them, anyone with access to the resources automatically agrees to comply to this licence and its terms, effectively becoming a licensee. Any violation of this licence immediately terminates the rights of the licensee under this licence.

**(II)** Any modifications of the files should be dated and thoroughly listed once such modifications are made public. This requirement is not a matter of limiting or controlling how the resources should be used, but to keep a spirit of trading: in return for the free use, it is asked that you help the licensor improve the resources.

**(III)** No warranty is given and liability is limited. No responsibility is taken for faults or losses since the resources here are provided "as is". In this sense, the licensor shall have no liability for damages like economical or data losses. Reestated, the use of the resources is given for free under the discretion of the licensee, and it is the licensee responsibility to properly test and/or prototype all the resources before manufacture or commercial distribution. This condition still applies even if the licensor has already prototyped the resources or parts of them. This is to protect the Acheron Project from its modifications; if any redistribution is infringing laws or rights, the licensor is not to be held responsible.

**(IV)** The fact that the resources can be copied, modified and redistributed do not mean that the licensor endorses or takes part in the development of other projects that may come from its copying, modifying or redistribution. It also does not imply the transfer or assignment of intellectual property or copyright rights to the licensee;

**(V)** Let's say that you want to make a project of your own based on one component of the Acheron Project. If the licensor has not taken part on those modifications not endorsed them, it is not reasonable that you can say your project belongs to the Acheron Project, and hence we ask that you remove the Acheron logos, names and web sites listed on the documentation and the resources. If you want your modifications to integrate Acheron, you must submit them to licensor revision (this is generally done through the pull request system) and the licensor must approve the modifications to be submitted to the official repository, obviously with due credit.

### 1.3 Resources

This licence applies to all the resources published in the documentation, including:

- Printed Circuit Boards ("PCBs"), their schematic diagrams, designs, circuit board layouts and descriptive text;

- The files used for PCBs manufacture like Gerber, SVG and PDF files that describe their mechanical and electrical profiles;

- The Bill of Materials ("BoM"), that describes the components used to manufacture the PCBs, their quantities and models, published in a sheet file or table;

- Parts modelling files like Computer Aided Design ("CAD") and Computer Aided Manufacture ("CAM") files, mechanical drawings and manufacturing, including but not limited to keyboard cases, keyboard plates, enclosures, keycap models and drawings;

- Artworks and graphics, such as images and promotional material;

- The descriptive Electronical CAD ("ECAD") or Mechanical CAD ("MCAD") files such as footprints, symbols, shapes, models and drawings, used in conjunction with ECAD/MCAD software to devise the resources;

- This license itself. Although this may sound confusing, Open-Hardware Licenses are still a gray area when it comes to legality, patents, intellectual property. As such, the licenses are constantly evolving and being transformed to attend the market demands. Hence if anyone wishes to use this license, commercially or not, and help make it clearer and more concise, the licensors hereby grant anyone the right to do so, commercially or not, with the single condition that any modifications are reported back to help us improve it.

This licence does not apply to:

- The software, firmware or code, loaded into programmable devices like microprocessors and microcontrollers, not endorsed by the licensor. For instance, it is perfectly possible that the user wishes to use a third-party firmware in conjunction with the hardware provided in this license; obviously the licensor cannot represent or speak for that firmware, since it was not of their authorship and the use of such firmware is generally subject to proper licensing, terms and conditions;

- The trademarks involved in some components names, brands and logos (for instance, Cortex, ALPS, Cherry, Gateron and so on). All respective brands and logos are proprties of their respective owners; such brands are mentioned only as means of asserting compatibility and usage (for example, "the PCBs use Cortex processors and are compatible with MX-style switches");

## 2 Licensing conditions

This section defines the conditions under which the licensor gives permission to the licensee to use, copy, modify and distribute the resources hereby licensed, including for commercial purposes, given that the licensee complies to the conditions in this section. Such permission is granted by the licensor, directly to the licensee, worlwide and without limitation of time.

Should the licensee violate any of the requirements, their rights under this license are immediately terminated.

### 2.1 Copying and modification

The licensor grantes the licensee worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive permission copy and modify the resources, given that:

- The modified resources carry legible and clear notices stating they are modified versions of the original project, with date and description of the modifications; the files before and after changes should also be made available. This includes created files such as manufaturing CAD files like STEP files, Gerber files, BoM lists, mechanical drawings and so on.

- The licensee makes the modfied resources available at the same level of abstraction than the original resources, preferably in the same format of the original resources and in open-source licenses and tools. If you use proprietary formats, you must also include open-format equivalent versions.

- Modified resources have to be licensed under the terms and conditions of this license, a later version of this same license, or a compatible license. Recommended compatible licenses are the [CERN OHL V1.2](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/uploads/631d587b78851f8b2789dff8b2d9790b/cern_ohl_v_1_2.pdf) the [TAPR OHL](https://www.tapr.org/ohl.html) or [Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/). For more information on how the open-hardware licensing is currently made, see [Ackerman's article](https://www.tapr.org/Ackermann_Open_Source_Hardware_Article_2009.pdf).

It is encouraged that the licensee use the Git versioning system to manage the changes and publish their modifications at a hosting website that supports Git, like GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket. Furthermore, any contributions are welcome, and a pull-request submission is also encouraged.

### 2.2 Manufacture and distribution of products

The licensor grants the licensee a worldwide, royalty-free and non-exclusive permission to manufacture, distribute and sell any products based on the Acheron Project resources and its components. Such manufacture and distribution is encouraged -- even commercially. It is required that the licensee complies with the requirements in section 2.1 and, additionally that:

- The recipients of such products have easy means of access to a copy of the license and documentation.

- The licensee inform the licensor the quantity, dates of selling or production and types of products manufactured.

### 2.3 Compliance recommendation

To comply with the licensing conditions, the licensor recommends that the licensee:

- Include the license file used in a LICENSE file in the documentation package; this makes it easier to understand the licensing terms.

- In the products, if the size and format allows, include a "Lincensed under the AOHL V1.1", substituting the name AOHL for the license used.

- Have a change history included with the files, be it through a CHANGES file included in the documentation or through a commit history;

- Have the original authors know about your distribution and modifications. This can be done via e-mail; particularly for the Acheron Project, this can be done through the pull-request system or including detailedly descripted commits.

In order to facilitate the compliance process, all these requirements can be easily fulfilled through the commit and pull request features of the git/GitHub platform.

## 3 General

### 3.1 Intellectual property and endorsement
