See [this page](https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/tsuki/intro.html) for the Tsuki documentation.

## Introduction

Tsuki is a universal 60% PCB, supporting per-key lighting using single-color LEDs, RGB underglow using WS2812C RGB LEDs and a multitude of layouts:

- Default ANSI bottom row;
- Classic HHKB (6.0u spacebar) bottom row;
- Tsangan bottom row (7.0u spacebar, also known as "simmetrical HHKB")
- Split backspace;
- Split left and right shifts;
- ISO and UK-ISO;
- ABNT and ABNT2 layouts.

Tsuki was heavily based on the [GH60](https://github.com/komar007/gh60), a legendary PCB designed by Komar with extensive feedback from the community.
